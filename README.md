### Technologies Used
React.Js
SpringBoot Java Framework
Heroku Hosting
PostGres Database
### Approach Taken
Used MVC method to create backend api, and react to create front end
### Challenges
Bit off far more than i could chew with the backend tech, leaving me with only a day and a half to do teh front end, and then lost a full days work due to power outage, leading to a poorly designed front end.
