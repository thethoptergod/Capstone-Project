            <strong>Lagavulin 11 Nick Offerman Review</strong>
            <div>
            My favorite whisky of all time, so good I am traveling to Scotland just to go to where it was made. The peat, the smoke, the fire, it all comes together to create an amazing flavor. <br></br>It is definitly not for everyone, and unless what I said sounds really good, I wouldnt reccomend it to beginners either. If you love the taste of a campfire, (it tastes better than you think!) I cannot reccomend anything better than this.
